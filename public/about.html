<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Born on November 2, 1995, in Istanbul, Turkey, I pursued my undergraduate degree in Metallurgy and Materials Engineering.
  My curiosity and desire to explore new cultures led me to participate in the Work and Travel Program in 2016, where I spent four months in Brooklyn, New York.
  This experience not only allowed me to immerse myself in new cultures but also solidified my dream of pursuing education in the United States.
</p>

<p>Following this dream, I returned to the U.S. in 2022 to start my Master's in Computer Science at Monroe College.
   Currently, I am dedicated to becoming a proficient developer, embracing the philosophy of learning through living. 
   My goal is to continually grow by experiencing life to the fullest and embracing every opportunity to learn and develop both professionally and personally.
